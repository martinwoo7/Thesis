# Cluster Plot
We present Clusterplot, a multi-class high-dimensional data visualization tool designed to visualize cluster-level information
and alleviate visual clutter. Our unique plots leverage 2D blobs devised to convey the geometrical and topological characteristics of
clusters within the high-dimensional data, and their pairwise relations, such that general inter-cluster behavior is easily interpretable.
Class identity supervision is utilized to drive the measuring of relations among clusters in high-dimension, particularly, proximity and
overlap, which are then reflected spatially through the 2D blobs. We demonstrate the strength of our clusterplots and their ability to
deliver a clear and informative exploration experience for high-dimensional clusters characterized by complex structure and significant
overlap.
